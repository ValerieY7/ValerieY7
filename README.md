## Hi there 👋 I'm Valerie Ye
I'm currently a college student studying global public health sciences, with an interest in tech and machine learning to understand and address the complex systems that shape people’s well-being. Seeing tech not only as an innovation but also as a means of social good, I hope to broaden my horizons in this field through research, creation, and community engagement.
