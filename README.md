## Hi there 👋 I'm Valerie Ye
I'm an incoming college student studying global public health sciences, with an interest in tech and machine learning in hopes to understand and address the complex systems that shape people’s well-being. Seeing tech not only as an innovation but also as a means of social good, I hope to broaden my horizons in this field through research, creation, and community engagement.

### A bit about me
I just graduated from high school and am spending my summer exploring new subjects including sharpening my coding skills before college. I'm especially interested in how technology intersects with real-world problems—whether that’s through public health, education, or creative websites.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Experience
Much of my experience throughout highschool includes volunteering- especially in culturally diverse settings. 
- ⛩️ _Chinatown Youth Initiative_ (Aiding Chinese immigrants in attaining higher English proficiency)
- 🌍 _The World In Us_ (Youth led initiative promoting cultural awareness across the world)
